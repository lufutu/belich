# Install

- First at all, you need to install **Laravel Jetstream** with the **Livewire** version.
- Now you must decide in what folder will be Belich installed. By default is installed in: `https://www.yourdomain.com/dashboard`. In this case, you need to go to the route's folder and open the file `routes/web.php` and remove the following code, generated by **Jetstream**:

```php
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'verified'])->get('/dashboard', function () {
    return view('dashboard');
})->name('dashboard');
```

If you decide to use another path, like for example: `dashboard/portal`, you have to update the `config.php` file with the new path, and nothing more.
